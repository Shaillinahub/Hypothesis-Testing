# Hypothesis-Testing
DESCRIPTION:
This project explores the concept of hypothesis testing in data analysis, focusing on the comparison of data usage between older and younger users. Using real-world user data, I formulated hypotheses, conducted various statistical tests, and interpreted the results to derive meaningful conclusions.

PROJECT DETAILS:
Data Source : KAGGLE
Tools Used : Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib & Seaborn
Results: Summarize key findings and any insights gained from the analysis.

Results
In this analysis, I examined the hypothesis that there is a significant difference in data usage between older individuals (aged over 30) and younger individuals. The null hypothesis stated: "There is no significant difference in data usage between older people and younger people."

Findings
Statistical Outcome: The results led to a failure to reject the null hypothesis, indicating no significant difference in data usage between the two age groups. This suggests that age may not play a crucial role in determining how much data individuals consume daily.

P-Value: The p-value obtained from the analysis was 0.56, which was greater than the significance level (Î± = 0.05). This further reinforces the conclusion that the data does not provide sufficient evidence to suggest a significant difference in usage patterns based on age.
